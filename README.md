#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the process or designing, creating and mantaining applications(software) that helps businesses and users in achieving their intended goals. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Agile Methodology (2001) – The Agile Manifesto introduced iterative development, customer collaboration, and adaptability, revolutionizing software development with methodologies like Scrum and Kanban.
2. Structured Programming (1970s-1980s) – Introduction of systematic coding practices like modularity, top-down design, and languages such as Pascal and C to improve code readability and maintainability.
3. Mastering Machine (2000s-Present) – Advances in hardware utilization, cloud computing, parallel processing, and AI-driven development to optimize performance and scalability across diverse platforms.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. **Planning** – Define objectives, feasibility, and resource allocation.  
2. **Requirements Analysis** – Gather and document user and system needs.  
3. **Design** – Create system architecture, UI, and database structure.  
4. **Implementation** – Write and test code based on design.  
5. **Testing** – Identify and fix bugs to ensure quality.  
6. **Deployment** – Release the software for users.  
7. **Maintenance** – Update, fix issues, and improve performance.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology is sequential implying the development is done phase by phase, while the agile methodology is an iterative flexible development
Waterfall methodology is used in large, well-defined projects like banking software or government systems where changes are costly.
On the other hand, the Agile methodology is used for dynamic projects like mobile apps or startup products where requirements evolve frequently.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A **Software Developer** writes, tests, and maintains code, ensuring functionality and efficiency. They collaborate with designers and analysts to implement system requirements.  

A **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer** focuses on testing software to identify bugs, improve performance, and ensure it meets quality standards through manual and automated testing.  

A **Project Manager** oversees planning, execution, and delivery, ensuring timelines, budgets, and team coordination while managing risks and stakeholder expectations.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
**Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)** streamline coding with features like debugging, syntax highlighting, and code completion, boosting productivity. Examples: **Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse**.  

**Version Control Systems (VCS)** track code changes, enable collaboration, and prevent conflicts, ensuring code integrity. Examples: **Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), Apache Subversion (SVN)**.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. **Managing Complexity** – Use modular design, design patterns, and best coding practices.  
2. **Debugging & Bug Fixes** – Write unit tests, use debugging tools, and follow structured testing.  
3. **Keeping Up with Technology** – Continuously learn through courses, blogs, and community engagement.  
4. **Meeting Deadlines** – Use Agile methods, prioritize tasks, and follow proper time management.  
5. **Collaboration Issues** – Communicate effectively, use VCS (e.g., Git), and hold regular meetings.  
6. **Security Vulnerabilities** – Follow secure coding practices, conduct code reviews, and use encryption.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. **Unit Testing** – Tests individual components or functions to ensure correctness. Detects early bugs.  
2. **Integration Testing** – Verifies interactions between modules to check data flow and communication.  
3. **System Testing** – Evaluates the entire system's functionality, performance, and compliance with requirements.  
4. **Acceptance Testing** – Ensures the software meets business needs and user expectations before deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
**Prompt engineering** is the practice of designing effective inputs to guide AI models in generating accurate and relevant responses.  

**Importance:** It optimizes AI performance, enhances output quality, improves efficiency in automation, and ensures clearer, more precise interactions for tasks like coding, content creation, and decision-making.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
**Vague Prompt:** "Tell me about cars."  

**Improved Prompt:** "Explain the key differences between electric and gasoline cars, including cost, performance, and environmental impact."  

**Why it's better?** It is specific, focused, and provides clear expectations, leading to a more useful and relevant AI response.
